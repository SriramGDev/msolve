`msolve` is an open source C library implementing computer algebra algorithms 
for solving polynomial systems (with rational coefficients or coefficients in a 
prime field). 

Currently, with `msolve`, you can basically solve multivariate polynomial systems. 
This encompasses: 
* the computation of **Groebner bases** 
* **real root isolation of the solutions** to polynomial systems
* the computation of the dimension and the degree of the solution set
and many other things you can do using msolve.

A tutorial is available at 
[https://msolve.lip6.fr](https://msolve.lip6.fr)

Some of the functionalities of [https://msolve.lip6.fr](msolve) are already available 
in the computer algebra systems [https://oscar-system.github.io/Oscar.jl](Oscar) 
and [https://trac.sagemath.org](SageMath). See below for some more information about 
this.

# Install Instructions

See the INSTALL file.

# Input File Format

More informations are given in the tutorial (see [https://msolve.lip6.fr](https://msolve.lip6.fr))

`msolve` input files need to be of the following format:

**1st line**: variables as commata separated list, e.g. `x1,x2,x3,x4,y1,y2`.<br/>
**2nd line**: field characteristic, e.g. `0`.<br/>
**following lines**: generating polynomials, all but the last one need
to terminate by a `,`, e.g.
```
x1,x2,x3,x4,y1,y2
101
x1+x2+x3+x4,
2*y1-145*y2
```
Polynomials may be multiline, thus `,` as a separator.

Coefficients can be rational, using `/`, e.g. `-2/3*x2*y1^2+...`.

# Basic usage

Some basic commands are as follows:

```
./msolve -f in.ms -o out.ms
```
will:
- detect if the input system has dimension at most 0
- when the system has dimension at most 0 and the coefficients are rational 
numbers, `msolve` will isolate the real solutions
- when the system has dimension at most 0 and the coefficients are in a prime field, 
`msolve` will compute a parametrization of the solutions 

All output data are displayed in the file `out.ms`

The `-v`flag allows you to control the verbosity, giving insight on what `msolve` 
is doing. Try this. 
```
./msolve -v 2 -f in.ms -o out.ms
```

# Computing Groebner bases

Currently, this functionality is provided when the base field is a prime one 
(characteristic should be less than 2^31). 

If the input system is with rational coefficients, the computation is performed 
modulo a randomly chosen prime. 
This allows you to obtain, with high probability, the image of the actual Groebner 
basis modulo this chosen prime, hence the dimension and the degree of the ideal generated 
by the input equations. 

The following command
```
./msolve -g 1 in.ms -o out.ms
```
will compute the leading monomials of the reduced Groebner basis of the ideal 
generated by the input system in `in.ms` for the so-called graded reverse lexicographic ordering. 
Using the `-g 2` flag as follows
```
./msolve -g 2 in.ms -o out.ms
```
will return the reduced Groebner basis when the base field is a prime field.

`msolve` also allows you to perform Groebner bases computations using 
**one-block elimination monomial order**
thanks to the `-e` flag. The following command 
```
./msolve -e 1 -g 2 in.ms -o out.ms
```
will perform the Groebner basis computation eliminating the first variable. 
More generally, using `-e k` will eliminate the `k` first variables.
