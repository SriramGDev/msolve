# Multivariate polynomial system solver 

[https://msolve.lip6.fr](https://msolve.lip6.fr)

With msolve, you can basically solve multivariate polynomial systems. 
This encompasses: 
* the computation of **Groebner bases** 
* **real root isolation of the solutions** to polynomial systems
* the computation of the dimension and the degree of the solution set
and many other things you can do using msolve.

Some documentation is available at

# Install Instructions

See the INSTALL file.

# Input File Format

More informations are given in the documentation (see [https://msolve.lip6.fr](https://msolve.lip6.fr))

`msolve` input files need to be of the following format:

**1st line**: variables as commata separated list, e.g. `x1,x2,x3,x4,y1,y2`.<br/>
**2nd line**: field characteristic, e.g. `0`.<br/>
**following lines**: generating polynomials, all but the last one need
to terminate by a `,`, e.g.
```
x1,x2,x3,x4,y1,y2
101
x1+x2+x3+x4,
2*y1-145*y2
```
Polynomials may be multiline, thus `,` as a separator.

Coefficients can be rational, using `/`, e.g. `-2/3*x2*y1^2+...`.

# Basic usage

Some basic commands are as follows:

```
./msolve -f in.ms -o out.ms
```
will:
- detect if the input system has dimension at most 0
- when the system has dimension at most 0 and the coefficients are rational 
numbers, `msolve` will isolate the real solutions
- when the system has dimension at most 0 and the coefficients are in a prime field, 
`msolve` will compute a parametrization of the solutions 

All output data are displayed in the file `out.ms`

```
./msolve -g 1 in.ms -o out.ms
```
will compute the leading monomials of the reduced Groebner basis of the ideal 
generated by the input system in `in.ms` for the so-called graded reverse lexicographic ordering. 
Using the `-g 2` flag will return the reduced Groebner basis when the base field is a prime field.
